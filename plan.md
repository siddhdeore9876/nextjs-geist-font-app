## Implementation Plan for PG/Hostel Platform Frontend

### Overview
This plan outlines the steps to create a React + Tailwind CSS frontend for a platform where students can browse, search, and filter PGs/Hostels, and PG/Hostel owners can list their properties. The application will consist of several pages, each with specific UI components and functionalities.

### Pages Required
1. **Home Page**
   - Hero section with platform introduction.
   - Search bar (location, price range, gender-specific).
   - Featured PGs/Hostels section (cards with image, price, location).

2. **PG/Hostel Listings Page**
   - Grid view of PGs/Hostels with filters (price, amenities, gender, location).
   - Each card should have: image, name, price/month, location, "View Details" button.

3. **PG/Hostel Detail Page**
   - Large images carousel.
   - Details: description, price, amenities, rules, contact owner button.

4. **Owner Dashboard Page**
   - Form to add new PG/Hostel listing (name, images, price, amenities, location, description).
   - Table/list to view and edit their existing PGs.

5. **Authentication Pages**
   - Login Page (for Students & Owners).
   - Signup Page (with role selection: Student / Owner).
